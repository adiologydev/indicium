A Proof Of Concept Memory Cache Database Developed on NodeJS

</div>

## Current Implementation

This is an experimental project and at this moment most of the functionality is not implemented.
The current setup is a simple REST API which interacts with the cache class.
In the future, I will implement pub/sub functionality along with most of the feature set.

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT AT THE MOMENT. IT IS NOT COMPLETE AND WILL NOT WORK.
